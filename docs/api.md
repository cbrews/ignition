### Methods

#### request(url: string, referer: string = None, timeout: float = None, raise_errors = False, ca_cert: Tuple[str, str] = None) -> ignition.BaseResponse
Given a *url* to a Gemini capsule, this performs a request to the specified url and returns a response (as a subclass of [ignition.BaseResponse](#ignitionbaseresponse)) with the details associated to the response.  This is the interface that most users should use.

If a *referer* is provided, a dynamic URL is constructed by ignition to send a request to. (*referer* expectes a fully qualified url as returned by `ignition.BaseResponse.url` or (less prefered) `ignition.url()`). Typically, in order to simplify the browsing experience, you should pass the previously requested URL as the referer to simplify URL construction logic.

*See `ignition.url()` for details around url construction with a referer.*

If a *timeout* is provided, this will specify the client timeout (in seconds) for this request.  The default is 30 seconds.  See also `ignition.set_default_timeout` to change the default timeout.

If a *ca_cert* is provided, the certificate will be sent to the server as a CA CERT.  You will need to provide the paths to both the certificate and the key in this case.

If *raise_errors* is `True` (default value = `False`), then non-protocol errors will bubble up and be raised as an exception instead of returning [ignition.ErrorResponse](#ignitionerrorresponse).

Depending on the response from the server, as per Gemini specification, the corresponding response type will be returned.

* If the response status begins with "1", the response type is `INPUT`, and will return a response of type [ignition.InputResponse](#ignitioninputresponse).
* If the response status begins with "2", the response type is `STATUS`, and will return a response of type [ignition.SuccessResponse](#ignitionsuccessresponse).
* If the response status begins with "3", the response type is `REDIRECT`, and will return a response of type [ignition.RedirectResponse](#ignitionredirectresponse).
* If the response status begins with "4", the response type is `TEMPORARY FAILURE`, and will return a response of type [ignition.TempFailureResponse](#ignitiontempfailureresponse).
* If the response status begins with "5", the response type is `PERMANENT FAILURE`, and will return a response of type [ignition.PermFailureResponse](#ignitionpermfailureresponse).
* If the response status begins with "6", the response type is `CLIENT CERTIFICATE REQUIRED`, and will return a response of type [ignition.ClientCertRequiredResponse](#ignitionclientcertrequiredresponse).
* If *no valid response* can be returned, ignition assigns a response type of "0" and returns a response of type [ignition.ErrorResponse](#ignitionerrorresponse).  Note: if the user specifies `raise_errors=True`, then any errors will bubble up instead of returning this response type.

Parameters:
* url: `string`
* referer: `string` (optional)
* timeout: `float` (optional)
* raise_errors: `bool` (optional)
* ca_cert: `Tuple(cert_file, key_file)` (optional)

Returns: `[ignition.BaseResponse](#ignitionbaseresponse)`

#### url(url: string, referer: string = None) -> string
Given a *url* to a Gemini capsule, this returns a standardized, fully-qualified url to the Gemini capsule.  If a *referer* is provided, a dynamic URL is constructed by ignition to send a request to.  This logic follows URL definition behavior outlined in [RFC-3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

This allows for the bulk of URL generation logic to be handled without ignition as opposed to within the business logic of the client.  Here are some sample use cases:

*Use Case 1: Automatically populate URL protocol*
```python
ignition.url('//gemini.circumlunar.space') # => gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space
```

*Use Case 2: Navigate to an absolute path*
```python
ignition.url('/home', 'gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space') # => gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/home
```

*Use Case 3: Navigate to a relative path*
```python
ignition.url('2', 'gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/home') # => gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/home/2
```

*Use Case 4: Resolve paths with navigation*
```python
ignition.url('../fun/', 'gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/home/work/') # => gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/home/fun/
```

*Note:* if the user's intent is to generate a url to a Gemini capsule and then make a request, ignition recommends that you just provide the *url* and *referer* to `ignition.request()`, as that function encapsulates all of the logic within this method when making a request.  If you want to retrieve a URL from an already processed request, it is recommended to use `ignition.BaseResponse.url`, as that will store the URL that was actually used.  This method is only intended for use in constructing a URL but not generating a request.

Parameters:
* url: `string`
* referer: `string` (optional)

Returns: `string`

#### set_default_timeout(timeout: float)
Set the default timeout (in seconds) for all requests made via ignition.  The default timeout is 30 seconds.

Parameters:
* timeout: `float`

#### set_default_hosts_file(hosts_file: string)
Set the default host file location where all of the certificate fingerprints are stored in order to support Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU) validation.  By default, this file is stored in the same directory as your project in a file named `.known_hosts`.  This can be updated to any readable location but should be stored somewhere persistent for security purposes.

The format of this file is very similar to (but not identical to) the SSH `known_hosts` file.

Parameters:
* hosts_file: `string`

### Constants

#### RESPONSE_STATUS_INPUT = "1"
Possible value for `ignition.BaseResponse.status`, and will appear in any response types of `ignition.InputResponse`.  As per the Gemini documentation, this means that the requested resource requires a line of textual user input. The same resource should then be requested again with the user's input included as a query component.

See `RESPONSE_STATUSDETAIL_INPUT*` for additional detailed responses for each potential response type.

#### RESPONSE_STATUS_SUCCESS = "2"
Possible value for `ignition.BaseResponse.status`, and will appear in any response types of `ignition.SuccessResponse`.

See `RESPONSE_STATUSDETAIL_SUCCESS*` for additional detailed responses for each potential response type.  As per the Gemini documentation, the request was handled successfully and a response body is included, following the response header. The META line is a MIME media type which applies to the response body.

#### RESPONSE_STATUS_REDIRECT = "3"
Possible value for `ignition.BaseResponse.status`, and will appear in any response types of `ignition.RedirectResponse`.  As per the Gemini documentation, the server is redirecting the client to a new location for the requested resource.  The URL may be absolute or relative.  The redirect should be considered temporary (unless specied otherwise in the detailed status), i.e. clients should continue to request the resource at the original address and should not performance convenience actions like automatically updating bookmarks.

There is currently no support for automatically following redirects in Ignition.

See `RESPONSE_STATUSDETAIL_REDIRECT*` for additional detailed responses for each potential response type.

#### RESPONSE_STATUS_TEMP_FAILURE = "4"
Possible value for `ignition.BaseResponse.status`, and will appear in any response types of `ignition.TempFailureResponse`.  As per the Gemini documentation, the request has failed. The nature of the failure is temporary, i.e. an identical request MAY succeed in the future.

See `RESPONSE_STATUSDETAIL_TEMP_FAILURE*` for additional detailed responses for each potential response type.

#### RESPONSE_STATUS_PERM_FAILURE = "5"
Possible value for `ignition.BaseResponse.status`, and will appear in any response types of `ignition.PermFailureResponse`.  As per the Gemini documentation, the request has failed.  The nature of the failure is permanent, i.e. identical future requests will reliably fail for the same reason.  Automatic clients such as aggregators or indexing crawlers should not repeat this request.

See `RESPONSE_STATUSDETAIL_PERM_FAILURE*` for additional detailed responses for each potential response type.

#### RESPONSE_STATUS_CLIENTCERT_REQUIRED = "6"
Possible value for `ignition.BaseResponse.status`, and will appear in any response types of `ignition.ClientCertRequiredResponse`.  As per the Gemini documentation, the requested resource requires a client certificate to access. If the request was made without a certificate, it should be repeated with one. If the request was made with a certificate, the server did not accept it and the request should be repeated with a different certificate.

See `RESPONSE_STATUSDETAIL_CLIENTCERT_REQUIRED*` for additional detailed responses for each potential response type.

#### RESPONSE_STATUS_ERROR = "0"
Possible value for `ignition.BaseResponse.status`, and will appear in any response types of `ignition.ErrorResponse`.  This status indicates that there was an error on transmission with the host and the request could not be completed.  These response types are specific to Ignition because they are beyond the scope of the Gemini protocol and typically indicate an error with networking or communication between the client and the host.

See `RESPONSE_STATUSDETAIL_ERROR*` for additional detailed responses for each potential response type.

This member SHOULD be used to facilitate status-specific behavior by a client.

#### meta
*type: `string` (length <= 1024 characters)*

`meta` is the raw meta field returned in the response header from the Gemini server.  In general, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use this in favor of `BaseResponse.data()` method to retrieve the meta field for non-20 responses, but this can be used if preferred.

#### raw_body
*type: `bytes`*

`raw_body` is the raw bytestring stored in the response, before encoding.  This response SHOULD only be used for debug purposes, but it is typically preferred to use `BaseResponse.data()` for success messages as this will decode the response body according to the charset provided in the response META.

#### url
*type: `string`*

Returns the fully qualified URL of the request after processing.  This value MAY be passed to subsequent responses in the `referer` field in order to help to construct fully qualified URLs on the request.

#### certificate
*type: [`cryptography.x509.Certificate`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/x509/reference.html#x-509-certificate-object)*

Returns the remote server certificate on a successful response.  If the type is [ignition.ErrorResponse](#ignitionerrorresponse), this will return `None`.

* [ignition.ErrorResponse](#ignitionerrorresponse)
* [ignition.InputResponse](#ignitioninputresponse)
* [ignition.SuccessResponse](#ignitionsuccessresponse)
* [ignition.RedirectResponse](#ignitionredirectresponse)
* [ignition.TempFailureResponse](#ignitiontempfailureresponse)
* [ignition.PermFailureResponse](#ignitionpermfailureresponse)
* [ignition.ClientCertRequiredResponse](#ignitionclientcertrequiredresponse)

Returns: `string`

#### success() -> boolean
Utility method to check if the response was successful, defined by a status response of `20`.

This is useful if you just need to confirm that the message contains a body or not.

Returns: `boolean`

#### is_a(response_class_type: class) -> boolean
Utility method to qualify the response type.  The response type from a request will be one of: ignition.ErrorResponse, ignition.InputResponse, ignition.SuccessResponse, ignition.RedirectResponse, ignition.TempFailureResponse, ignition.TempFailureResponse, ignition.PermFailureResponse, ignition.ClientCertRequiredResponse.  This will return `true` if the response type matches the current object type.

This is recommended for use when routing behavior based on a response.

*Note: This only qualifies the `basic_status` of a response.  For any additional behavior it is required to check the `BaseResponse.status` for detailed status.*

Parameters:
* response_class_type: `ignition.BaseResponse` class

Returns: `boolean`
